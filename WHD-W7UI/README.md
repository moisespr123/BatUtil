after installing the OS, you need to run it as administrator, it will be self-deleted afterwards

* for offline integration, to rebuild wim files, you need either of:  
- imagex.exe placed next to WHD-W7UI.cmd  
- Windows 8.1 ADK or Windows 10 ADK is installed  
- Host OS is Windows 8.1 or later

* WinPE images (boot.wim/winre.wim) will be updated only with:  
- Servicing Stack Update  
- SHA2 Code Signing Support Update  
- Extended Servicing Stack Update  
- Monthly Quality Rollup

* Extra registry settings will be added one time only if "Hotfixes" option is YES

## Debug Mode (for advanced users):
